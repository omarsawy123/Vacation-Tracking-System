## Domain Problem

Managing vacations in a company for employees is a tedious and resource-intensive process.  

Examples:  

1. **Multi-Step Approvals**  
   The process often requires multiple steps, such as manager and HR approvals, with each step consuming significant time and effort.  

2. **Policy and Budget Verification**  
   Employees need to manually check vacation policies and their leave budgets every time they submit a request, adding to their workload and risking errors.  

3. **Policy Updates**  
   When HR introduces new rules or updates, it requires considerable time and resources to inform employees and ensure compliance.  

4. **Manual HR Workload**  
   HR teams must validate each request against rules and budgets, which is particularly challenging in large companies with high volumes of requests.  

To resolve these issues, we introduce a system that automates the vacation management process, streamlining workflows, ensuring compliance, and addressing the unique needs of each stakeholder efficiently.
