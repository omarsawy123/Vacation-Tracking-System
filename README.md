# Vacation-Tracking-System


A system developed for companies to manage thier vacation system for thier employees making the process automated and efficient 

## Domain Problem

Managing vacations in a company for employees is a tedious and resource-intensive process.  

Examples:  

1. **Multi-Step Approvals**  
   The process often requires multiple steps, such as manager and HR approvals, with each step consuming significant time and effort.  

2. **Policy and Budget Verification**  
   Employees need to manually check vacation policies and their leave budgets every time they submit a request, adding to their workload and risking errors.  

3. **Policy Updates**  
   When HR introduces new rules or updates, it requires considerable time and resources to inform employees and ensure compliance.  

4. **Manual HR Workload**  
   HR teams must validate each request against rules and budgets, which is particularly challenging in large companies with high volumes of requests.  

To resolve these issues, we introduce a system that automates the vacation management process, streamlining workflows, ensuring compliance, and addressing the unique needs of each stakeholder efficiently.  



## Actors

In our system, we have four key actors:  

1. **Employee (Main Actor)**  
   The employee initiates vacation requests, checks available leave balances, and reviews relevant policies. The system simplifies their experience by automatically verifying eligibility, displaying leave balances, and ensuring requests comply with company rules.  

2. **Manager**  
   The manager reviews and approves or rejects employee vacation requests. The system provides managers with a view all requests to approve or reject with description field.  

3. **HR**  
   The HR team oversees policy compliance, manages updates to vacation rules, and monitors overall leave usage. The system automates rule enforcement, significantly reducing manual work and allowing HR to focus on other things.  

4. **System Admin**  
   The system admin configures and maintains the vacation management platform, ensuring seamless operation. They handle permissions, system updates, and technical configurations to align with the companyâ€™s needs.
